This project is a simple modal i created using javascript, html, and css for the styling, so basically what this does is if you click on the test modal button, it calls a javascript function and displays the modal as a pop-up with slide in animation of course,
the essense of this project is to basically sharpen my javascript skills so i will be confident enough to head back into react.
